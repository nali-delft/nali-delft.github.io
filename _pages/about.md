I am a postdoc researcher at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs), working with [Simon Tindemans](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/s.h.tindemans/?cHash=bbd0716f167aafde79f6f0ec465da7c3) and [Kenneth Bruninx](https://www.kennethbruninx.com/home).

My research focuses on modeling and simulation of energy systems, energy market, tariff design, energy system analysis, and demand-side flexibility provision. 

In addition to my research, I also contribute to the academic community by serving as a reviewer for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews，Applied Energy, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks, Frontiers in Energy Research, and IET Generation, Transmission & Distribution.

I am open for discussions and collaboration, feel free to reach out to me.
